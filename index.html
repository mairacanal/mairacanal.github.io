    <p>The Linux kernel 6.8 came out on March 10th, 2024, bringing brand-new features
and plenty of performance improvements on different subsystems. As part of
Igalia, I’m happy to be an active part of many
features that are released in this version, and today I’m going to review some
of them.

    <p>Igalia is always working hard to improve 3D rendering
drivers of the Broadcom VideoCore GPU, found in Raspberry Pi devices. One of our
most recent efforts in this sense was the implementation of CPU jobs from the
Vulkan driver to the V3D kernel driver.

    <p>After finishing up my first Igalia Coding Experience in January, I got the amazing opportunity to keep working in the DRI community by extending my Igalia CE to a second round.
Huge thanks to Igalia for providing me with this opportunity!

    <p>This blogpost was actually written partially in November/December 2022 while I was developing IGT tests for the V3D driver.
I ended up leaving it aside for a while and now, I came back and finished the last loose ends.
That’s why I’m referencing the time where I was fighting against V3D’s noop jobs.

    <p>In my last blog post, I described a bit of my previous work on the rustgem project, and after that, as I had finished the VGEM features, I sent a RFC to the mailing list.
Although I still need to work on some rustgem feedback, I started to explore more of the KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) and its properties.

    <p>After my last blogpost, I kept developing the Rust version of the VGEM driver,
also known as rustgem for now. Previously, I had developed two important
features of the driver: the ability to attach a fence and the ability to signal
a fence. Still one important feature is still missing: the ability to prevent
hangs. Currently, if the fence is not signaled, the driver will simply hang. So,
we can create a callback that signals the fence when the fence is not signaled
by the user for more than 10 seconds.

    <p>In the last blog post, I pointed out that I didn’t know exactly what it would be
my next steps for the near future. Gladly, I had the amazing opportunity to
start a new Igalia Coding
Experience with a new project.

    <p>2022 really passed by fast and after I completed the GSoC 2022, I’m now
completing another milestone: my project in the Igalia Coding
Experience and I
had the best experience during those four months. I learned tremendously about
the Linux graphics stack and now I can say for sure that I would love to keep
working in the DRM community.

    <p>It has been a busy couple of months. As I pointed on my last blog post, I finished GSoC and joined the Igalia Coding Experience mentorship project. In October, I also traveled to Minneapolis for XDC 2022 where I presented to the Linux Graphics community our AMD/KUnit work with my colleagues. So, let’s make a summary of the last couple of months.

    <p>My journey on the Google Summer of Code project passed by so fast… This is my
last week on the GSoC and those 14 weeks flew by! A lot of stuff happened during
those three months, and as I’m writing this blog post, I feel quite nostalgic
about this three months.

    <p>This week I was planning on talking about Device Mocking with KUnit, as I’m currently working on my first unit test for a physical device, the AMDGPU Radeon RX5700. I would introduce you to the Kernel Unit Testing Framework (KUnit), how it works, how to mock devices with it, and why it is so great to write tests.

    <p>There are many ways to bring Real-Time to Linux. A standard Linux distribution can provide a reasonable latency to a soft real-time application. But, if you are dealing with applications with harsh timing restrictions, you might be unsatisfied with the results provided by a standard Linux distro.

    <p>I started my journey with the Linux Kernel in October 2021. At that time, I thought it was impossible for a 19-year-old Brazilian girl to have an approved commit at the kernel. Then, I find out about an extracurricular group at Campinas, LKCAMP. And I found out that undergraduate students were able to contribute to the kernel. Although I couldn´t go to the LKCAMP meetings, this really push me forward, cause I saw that I was able to be a part of the kernel community.
